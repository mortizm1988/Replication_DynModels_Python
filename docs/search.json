    "text": "The cumulative output of the project evolves according to: \ndX_t = A_t dt + \\sigma dB_t\n\nThe continuation value W_t is the total utility that the principal expects the agent to derive from the future after a given moment of time t:\n\nW_t = \\mathbb{E}^A \\left[ \\int_t^\\infty e^{-r(s-t)} \\left( u(C_s) - h(A_s) \\right) ds \\mid \\mathcal{F}_t \\right],\n\nwhere: - r is the discount rate, - u(C_s) is the utility from consumption C_s, - h(A_s) is the disutility from effort A_s, - \\mathbb{E}^A denotes the expectation under the probability measure induced by the agent’s effort strategy A, - \\mathcal{F}_t represents the information available up to time t.\nDefine the agent’s total expected utility up to time t as:\n\nV_t = r \\int_0^t e^{-rs} \\left( u(C_s) - h(A_s) \\right) ds + e^{-rt} W_t.\n\nThis formulation accounts for both the accumulated utility up to time t and the discounted continuation value W_t.\nUnder the agent’s optimal effort strategy, V_t should be a martingale with respect to the filtration \\mathcal{F}_t generated by the observable output process X_t. This implies:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\ndV_t &= r e^{-rt} \\left( u(C_t) - h(A_t) \\right) dt - r e^{-rt} W_t dt + e^{-rt} dW_t \\\\\n&= 0.\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThe Martingale Representation Theorem states that any martingale can be expressed as an integral with respect to a Brownian motion. Thus, there exists a progressively measurable process Y_t such that:\n\ndV_t = r e^{-rt} Y_t \\sigma dZ_t,\n\nwhere: - \\sigma is the volatility of the output process, - Z_t is a standard Brownian motion under the probability measure corresponding to the agent’s effort.\nDerive the Dynamics of W_t:\nEquating the two expressions for dV_t and solving for dW_t, we obtain:\n\n\\begin{align}\ndW_t = r \\left( W_t - u(C_t(W_t)) + h(A_t(W_t)) \\right) dt + r Y_t(W_t) (dX_t-A(W_t)dt).\n\\end{align}\n\nHere, Y_t represents the sensitivity of the agent’s continuation value to changes in the output process X_t. Notice that dX_t-A(W_t)dt=\\sigma dZ_t.\nIf the agent takes the contracted level of effort, then \\mathbb{E}[dX_t-A(W_t)]=0, so in that case, the drift of the continuation value is r \\left( W_t - u(C_t(W_t)) + h(A_t(W_t)) \\right).\nInterpretation:\n\nDrift: The continuation value grows at the interest rate r, minus the agent’s utility from consumption and the disutility from effort at time t.\nIncentives: If the agent deviate from the contracted effort level, the actual effort impacts the drift of its continuation value through the second term in dW_t.\n\nThe agent’s optimal effort is chosen to maximize the expected change in the continuation value \\mathbb{E}[dW_t] minus the cost of effort h(A_t): rY(W_t)A_t-r*h(A_t). As effort is compensated, the principal will set the sensitivity Y(W_t) that the minimum level that induces the agent to choose the contracted effort level.\nwhen the cost of effort is differentiable, the optimal effort sensitivity in the contract is \\gamma(a)=h'(a)."
