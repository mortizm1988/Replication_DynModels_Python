    "text": "The agent’s continuation value at time t is defined as:\n\nW_t = \\mathbb{E}^A \\left[ \\int_t^\\infty e^{-r(s-t)} \\left( u(C_s) - h(A_s) \\right) ds \\mid \\mathcal{F}_t \\right],\n\nwhere: - r is the discount rate, - u(C_s) is the utility from consumption C_s, - h(A_s) is the disutility from effort A_s, - \\mathbb{E}^A denotes the expectation under the probability measure induced by the agent’s effort strategy A, - \\mathcal{F}_t represents the information available up to time t.\nDefine the agent’s total expected utility up to time t as:\n\nV_t = r \\int_0^t e^{-rs} \\left( u(C_s) - h(A_s) \\right) ds + e^{-rt} W_t.\n\nThis formulation accounts for both the accumulated utility up to time t and the discounted continuation value W_t.\nUnder the agent’s optimal effort strategy, V_t should be a martingale with respect to the filtration \\mathcal{F}_t generated by the observable output process X_t. This implies:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\ndV_t &= r e^{-rt} \\left( u(C_t) - h(A_t) \\right) dt - r e^{-rt} W_t dt + e^{-rt} dW_t \\\\\n&= 0.\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThe Martingale Representation Theorem states that any martingale can be expressed as an integral with respect to a Brownian motion. Thus, there exists a progressively measurable process Y_t such that:\n\ndV_t = r e^{-rt} Y_t \\sigma dZ_t,\n\nwhere: - \\sigma is the volatility of the output process, - Z_t is a standard Brownian motion under the probability measure corresponding to the agent’s effort.\nDerive the Dynamics of $W_t:\nEquating the two expressions for dV_t and solving for dW_t, we obtain:\n\ndW_t = r \\left( W_t - u(C_t) + h(A_t) \\right) dt + r Y_t \\sigma dZ_t.\n\nHere, Y_t represents the sensitivity of the agent’s continuation value to changes in the output process X_t.\nInterpretation:\n\nDrift Term: The term r \\left( W_t - u(C_t) + h(A_t) \\right) dt captures the deterministic change in the continuation value due to the passage of time, the agent’s consumption, and effort.\nDiffusion Term: The term r Y_t \\sigma dZ_t represents the stochastic fluctuation in W_t driven by the randomness in the output process."
